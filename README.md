#### archive / historical event data

Historical news events from 2007 are already scraped and kept in a separate csv archive file, also available in "[releases](https://github.com/4evermaat/news_downloader_forexfactory/releases/)" section.  Default FF timezone is New York City timezone.  If the archive filename matches what is in the `news downloader.exe` settings, it will automatically append scraped data to the csv file.   So make sure you scrape backwards far enough to capture all the missing data to avoid gaps.

**All credit goes to [Hanover](https://www.forexfactory.com/hanover)**  He is not very active anymore, but may fix the occassional bug if the main scraper becomes broken.   It's pretty stable and should only break if FF changes the page format.
